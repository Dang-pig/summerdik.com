        content: "Halong Bay is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most popular travel destinations in Vietnam. They bay belongs to Hạ Long city, Cẩm Phả city and a part of Vân Đồn district in Quảng Ninh province, Vietnam.\n<div class='img-wrapper' style='border-top-left-radius: 3mm; border-bottom-left-radius: 3mm;'><img class='content-img card-img-in-wrapper zoomable' src='images/halongbay1.jpg' alt='Vung Ha beach'></div>\n<h5 align='center'>A picture of Vụng Hà beach - Hạ Long</h5>\nHalong Bay has an area of around 1553 km2 and features thousands of limestone karsts and is lets in various shapes and sizes. The bay consists of a dense cluster of some 1600 limestone monolithic islands each topped with thick jungle vegetation, rising spectacularly from the ocean. Several islands are hollow, with enormous caves. In each limestone island, an abundance of lakes can be found inside. A community of around 1600 people live on Halong Bay in four fishing villages: Cua Van, Ba Hang, Cong Tau and Vong Vieng in Hung Thang ward, but there are also permanent inhabitants in Tuan Chau and Cat Ba islands, as well as tourist facilities such as hotels and beautiful beaches. Approximately 40 of the 1969 islands in HaLong are inhabited. These islands range from tens to thousands of hectares in size. The climate of the bay is tropical, wet, sea islands, with two separate seasons: the hot and moist summer and the dry, cold winter.\nThe best way to discover Halong Bay is by cruise. Tourists and visitors are encouraged to choose at least a 2 day 1 night cruise to fully enjoy the bay. The time of the trip is also important: some summer days may have volatile weather and could lead to cancellations. You should also let the cruise operators know about any dietary restrictions or allergies that you might have.\n<div class='img-wrapper' style='border-top-left-radius: 3mm; border-bottom-left-radius: 3mm;'><img class='content-img card-img-in-wrapper zoomable' src='images/halongbay2.jpg' alt='Ngoc Vung island'></div>\n<h5 align='center'>Ngọc Vừng island - Hạ Long</h5>\nPacking for the trip is very important. The weather may be very unpredictable in this area so it is essential that you prepare things appropriate for these conditions. There is little-to-no phone reception in most places and your belongings may get wet in some activities such as kayaking, so be prepared in all of these scenarios.\nTo pack for the trip, you need to be smart and be prepared. Always bring your travel document (passport and/or ID card) as any boats or hotels will require this for you to stay. You should pack clothes that are weather appropriate and always prepare some waterproof jackets in case of unexpected rainfall. Comfortable shoes are important if you are to visit caves, as well as swimwear for kayaking or beach trips. Sunscreen is also essential as the sun is typically very strong in Vietnam. Try to pack in smaller suitcases to fit on the boat cabins on cruises, and any snacks and drinks is optional if you want on your trip.\nThere are three main ways to get to Halong Bay, either by plane, on a private bus, or a private motorbike/car trip. Tourists may choose to go on a 30-minute seaplane flight that is rather expensive (45-150 US dollars), or go with the much cheaper options of going on a bus or a car on a three-hour trip. Once we get there, there are two main accommodation options, that is to either take an overnight cruise or stay on one of the bigger islands, such as Cat Ba. If you were to take a cruise, make sure that you do a thorough research about the experience and the cost. If you choose to stay on the island, a wide range of options from budget hostels to nicer hotels is available for you.\nThere are many specialties and unique dishes in the area, ranging from seafood dishes to special kinds of cake with sticky rice, and tourists are always encouraged to try them. There are lots of activities that should be on your bucket list once you get there, and here are a few:\n<a href='blog.html?id=3'>> Kayaking through the limestone karsts Visit the floating villages of the locals</a>\n<a href='#'>> Explore the caves and grottoe</a>\n<a href='#'>> Relax on one of the thousands of unspoiled beaches</a>\n<a href='#'>> Visit the Tung Sau Pearl Farm</a>\nSources:\nWikipedia\n<a href='https://www.visithalongbay.com/travel-tips/halong-bay-first-time-guide.html'>https://www.visithalongbay.com/travel-tips/halong-bay-first-time-guide.html</a>",

        content: "With a population of about 5000 people, Ilulissat is the third-largest city in Greenland. It is famous for its incredible Icefjord, with several ways offered by the community to experience these large ice sculptures. In addition, there are also plenty of other natural and cultural activities that should be on your bucket list on your trip here.\n<div class='img-wrapper' style='border-top-left-radius: 3mm; border-bottom-left-radius: 3mm;'><img class='content-img card-img-in-wrapper zoomable' src='images/ilulissat1.jpg' alt='ilulissat'></div>\n<h5 align='center'>Ilulissat - Greenland</h5>\nIlulissat is located on the west coast of Greenland, about 350 km north of the Arctic Circle. The town sits on the shores of Disko Bay, whose nutrient-rich waters attract a wide range of seals and whales, making it the best place in all of the country to go whale watching. The city is stunning all year around, though there might be cold weather during the winter/spring and some mosquitoes and flies during June-August.\nAs the city is just a few hundred kilometers away from the Arctic Circle, be prepared to stay warm here with layered clothing. At the very least, you should have a base layer, a light jacket and waterproof outer layer clothes, with head covering, gloves, mittens and scarves as well. Especially in the colder months, you should always be prepared for cold weather, but there are also some town stores that can help you if you are underdressed. In addition, prepare your own portable charger since the cold may drain your batteries faster, and have some mapping apps ready to navigate through the city. You might want to prepare other items according to the time you visit the city, such as a head net and insect repellent if you are to go in June to August.\nYou can reach the city by plane or boat, either by flying from Iceland or Denmark, or taking a cruise to Greenland. The city is quite small, so walking is a good option, but you may also choose to take taxis or water-based taxis.",

        content: "As one of the most popular cities in the world, London is home to charming pubs, world-class museums, a rich history, incredible food, wild nightlife and a lot more. The city is quite expensive to travel to, but budget tourists can still have a good time. \nSome places to see and do in London:\n<a href='#'>> Visit Big Ben and the House of Parliament\n<a href='#'>> See the Tower of London and Tower Bridge\n<a href='#'>> Admire Buckingham Palace\n<a href='#'>> See Westminster Abbey\n<a href='#'>> Hang out in Trafalgar Square\n<a href='#'>> Take a free walking tour\n<a href='#'>> Visit some world-class (and sometimes free) museums\n<a href='#'>> Grab some food in Borough Market\n<a href='#'>> Enjoy some theater performances\nThere are a lot of activities to do in this beautiful city, and a trip will definitely not fit everything. However, you should take a look at some popular ones and plan out a schedule that will fit you the best throughout the trip. \nA bed in a dorm in hostels is the cheapest accommodation option in London, costing around 16-25 GBP/night, while a private room is a bit more expensive. Budget hotel prices can range from 70-100 GBP per night and are typically higher in the center and peak travel season. Airbnb is also an option and prices can vary from 45-60 GBP/night for a private room, to 90-150 GBP/night for an entire home. You should expect free Wi-Fi, TV and also free breakfast and self-catering facilities in most places. \nTo navigate around the city, public transportation such as buses or trams are typically the cheapest, while taking the bike-sharing program is definitely possible all around the city. Taxis, Uber and car rental are also other options, however traffic is terrible, and driving on the left can be quite unusual to you at first, so it may be better in most cases to stick to bikes or public transportation systems. \nThe weather here is not too cold, but it can get notoriously foggy and rainy. The temperature is warmest in the summer, which is the peak tourism season, rarely getting above 30 degrees Celsius. The city has a fun, lively atmosphere so people can make the most out of the warm weather with tons of events and festivals. However, visiting in the spring and autumn is also a fantastic choice as the city is not as packed, while winter typically has cold weather and a lot less crowds of tourists, so dressing warmly is a must. \nThe city is safe and has a low risk of crime rate, however, it is always important to stay cautious and look out for scams and pick-pocketing, especially in packed tourist attractions or places. Some standard precautions also apply, such as never walking home alone intoxicated, or never leaving your drink unattended for too long at a bar, and avoiding wandering late at night (especially after a few pints). If you want to be safer, only bring enough money to the bar, leave the rest of your cards and cash in your accommodation, and also make sure to look up advice from locals and travelers online. Scams are rare, but you should still learn a thing or two to avoid getting ripped off. \nFinally, prepare for some unexpected events, such as possible terrorist attacks or riots. Save some important phone numbers during your trip (such as 999 for police assistance) and purchase good travel insurance. Always be safe than sorry!\n\nSource: <a href='https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/england-travel-tips/london/'>https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/england-travel-tips/london/</a>",
